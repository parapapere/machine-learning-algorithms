# Machine Learning Algorithms 
Welcome to the repository for machine learning algorithms developed during a university course. Explore four comprehensive notebooks covering various aspects of machine learning:

1. **[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Wine Classification:](knn.ipynb)**
   - Utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors for [wine classification](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine), comparing models and exploring the impact of varying the number of neighbors.

2. **[Perceptron Binary Classification:](linear_perceptron_clasification.ipynb)**
   - Implements a perceptron algorithm for binary classification on the ["Banknote Authentication Data"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).
   - Includes data visualization, algorithm implementation, training progress visualization, and model testing.


3. **[Perceptron Multi-Class Classification:](one_vs_all_linear_perceptron_clasification.ipynb)**
   - Implements a perceptron algorithm for multi-class wine classification, training on three binary classification tasks and visualizing the training process.

4. **[Multi-Class Classification Models Comparison:](scikit_learn_models.ipynb)**
   - Compares performance across various machine learning models (K-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees) for multi-class wine classification.

**Note:** Ensure the required libraries are installed, and follow the provided instructions for dataset paths before running the notebooks.
